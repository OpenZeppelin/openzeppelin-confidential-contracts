== Security

Contracts in the community library are provided as is, with no particular guarantees. Given changes in this repository are more frequent, the code is not formally audited and not covered by the https://www.immunefi.com/bounty/openzeppelin[bug bounty program on Immunefi].

Similarly, the code has no backward compatibility guarantees.

We kindly ask to report any issue directly to our security mailto:security@openzeppelin.org[contact]. The team will do its best to assist and mitigate any potential misuses of the library. However, keep in mind the flexibility assumed for this repository may relax our assessment.
