= Confidential Fungible Token

The xref:api:token.adoc#ConfidentialFungibleToken[Confidential Fungible Token] is a standard fungible token implementation that is similar to `ERC20`, but built from the ground up with confidentiality in mind. All balance and transfer amounts are represented as cypher-text handles, ensuring that no data is leaked to the public.

[[usage]]
== Usage

[[transfer]]
=== Transfer

The token standard exposes eight different transfer functions. They are all permutations of the following options:

* `transfer` and `transferFrom`: `transfer` moves tokens from the sender while `transferFrom` moves tokens from a specified `from` address. See xref:#operator[operator].
* With and without `inputProof`: An `inputProof` can be provided to prove that the sender knows the value of the cypher-text `amount` provided.
* With and without an `ERC1363` style callback: The standard implements callbacks, see the callback section for more details.

Select the appropriate transfer function and generate a cypher-text using https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-js[fhevm-js]. If the cypher-text is a new value, or the sender does not have permission to access the cypher text, an input-proof must be provided to show that the sender knows the value of the cypher-text.

[[operator]]
=== Operator

An operator is an address that has the ability to move tokens on behalf of another address by calling `transferFrom`. If Bob is an operator for Alice, Bob can move any amount of Alice's tokens at any point in time. Operators are set using an expiration timestamp--this can be thought of as a limited duration infinite approval for an `ERC20`. Below is an example of setting Bob as an operator for Alice for 24 hours.

```typescript
const alice: Wallet;
const expirationTimestamp = Math.round(Date.now()) + 60 * 60 * 24; // Now + 24 hours

await tokenContract.connect(alice).setOperator(bob, expirationTimestamp);
```

WARNING: Setting an operator for any amount of time allows the operator to _**take all of your tokens**_. Carefully vet all potential operators before giving operator approval.

[[callback]]
=== Callback

The token standard exposes transfer functions with and without callbacks. It is up to the caller to decide if a callback is necessary for the transfer. For smart contracts that support it, callbacks allow the operator approval step to be skipped and directly invoke the receiver contract via a callback.

Smart contracts that are the target of a callback must implement xref:api:interfaces.adoc#IConfidentialFungibleTokenReceiver[IConfidentialFungibleTokenReceiver]. After balances are updated for a transfer, the callback is triggered by calling the xref:api:interfaces.adoc#IConfidentialFungibleTokenReceiver-onConfidentialTransferReceived-address-address-euint64-bytes-[onConfidentialTransferReceived] function. The function must either revert or return an `ebool` indicating success. If the callback returns false, the token transfer is reversed.

=== Privileged Minter/Burner

Here is an example of a contract with a privileged minter and burner.

=== Swaps

Swapping is one of the most primitive use-cases for fungible tokens. Below are examples for swapping between confidential and non-confidential tokens.

==== Swap `ERC20` to `ConfidentialFungibleToken`

Swapping from a non-confidential `ERC20` to a confidential `ConfidentialFungibleToken` is simple and actually done within the `ConfidentialFungibleTokenERC20Wrapper`. See the excerpt from the `wrap` function below.

[source,solidity]
----
function wrap(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual {
    // take ownership of the tokens
    SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(underlying(), msg.sender, address(this), amount - (amount % rate()));

    // mint confidential token
    _mint(to, (amount / rate()).toUint64().asEuint64());
}
----

The `ERC20` token is simply transferred in, which would revert on failure. We then transfer out the correct amount of the `ConfidentialFungibleToken` using the internal `_mint` function, which is guaranteed to succeed.

==== Swap `ConfidentialFungibleToken` to `ConfidentialFungibleToken`

Swapping from a confidential `ConfidentialFungibleToken` to another confidential `ConfidentialFungibleToken` is a bit more complex although quite simple given the usage of the `TFHE` library. For the sake of the example, we will swap from `fromToken` to `toToken` with a 1:1 exchange rate.

```solidity
function swapConfidentialForConfidential(IConfidentialFungibleToken fromToken, IConfidentialFungibleToken toToken, address from, euint64 amount) public virtual {
    require(fromToken.isOperator(address(this), msg.sender));

    amount.allowTransient(address(fromToken));
    euint64 amountTransferred = fromToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    
    amountTransferred.allowTransient(address(toToken));
    toToken.transfer(msg.sender, amountTransferred);
}
```
The steps are as follows:

. Check operator approval
. Allow the `fromToken` to access `amount`
. Transfer from `from` to this contract for `amount`
. Allow the `toToken` to access `amountTransferred`
. Transfer `amountTransferred` to `msg.sender`

==== Swap `ConfidentialFungibleToken` to `ERC20`

Swapping from a confidential token to a non-confidential token is the most complex since the decrypted data must be accessed to accurately complete the request.
