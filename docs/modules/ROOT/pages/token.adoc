= ERC7984

xref:api:token.adoc#ERC7984[`ERC7984`] is a standard fungible token implementation that is similar to ERC-20, but built from the ground up with confidentiality in mind. All balance and transfer amounts are represented as ciphertext handles, ensuring that no data is leaked to the public. 

While the standard is built with inspiration from ERC-20, it is not ERC-20 compliant--the standard takes learning from all tokens built over the past 10 years (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, ERC-6909 etc) and provides an interface for maximal functionality.

[[usage]]
== Usage

[[transfer]]
=== Transfer

The token standard exposes eight different transfer functions. They are all permutations of the following options:

* `transfer` and `transferFrom`: `transfer` moves tokens from the sender while `transferFrom` moves tokens from a specified `from` address. See xref:#operator[operator].
* With and without `inputProof`: An `inputProof` can be provided to prove that the sender knows the value of the ciphertext `amount` provided.
* With and without an `ERC1363` style callback: The standard implements callbacks, see the xref:#callback[callback] section for more details.

Select the appropriate transfer function and generate a ciphertext using https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-js[fhevm-js]. If the ciphertext is a new value, or the sender does not have permission to access the ciphertext, an input-proof must be provided to show that the sender knows the value of the ciphertext.

[[operator]]
=== Operator

An operator is an address that has the ability to move tokens on behalf of another address by calling `transferFrom`. If Bob is an operator for Alice, Bob can move any amount of Alice's tokens at any point in time. Operators are set using an expiration timestamp--this can be thought of as a limited duration infinite approval for an `ERC20`. Below is an example of setting Bob as an operator for Alice for 24 hours.

```typescript
const alice: Wallet;
const expirationTimestamp = Math.round(Date.now()) + 60 * 60 * 24; // Now + 24 hours

await tokenContract.connect(alice).setOperator(bob, expirationTimestamp);
```

NOTE: Operators do not have allowance to reencrypt/decrypt balance handles for other addresses. This means that operators cannot transfer full balances and can only know success after a transaction (by decrypting the transferred amount).

WARNING: Setting an operator for any amount of time allows the operator to _**take all of your tokens**_. Carefully vet all potential operators before giving operator approval.

[[callback]]
=== Callback

The token standard exposes transfer functions with and without callbacks. It is up to the caller to decide if a callback is necessary for the transfer. For smart contracts that support it, callbacks allow the operator approval step to be skipped and directly invoke the receiver contract via a callback.

Smart contracts that are the target of a callback must implement xref:api:interfaces.adoc#IERC7984Receiver[`++IERC7984Receiver++`]. After balances are updated for a transfer, the callback is triggered by calling the xref:api:interfaces.adoc#IERC7984Receiver-onConfidentialTransferReceived-address-address-euint64-bytes-[`++onConfidentialTransferReceived++`] function. The function must either revert or return an `ebool` indicating success. If the callback returns false, the token transfer is reversed.

== Examples

=== Privileged Minter/Burner

Here is an example of a contract for a confidential fungible token with a privileged minter and burner.

=== Swaps

Swapping is one of the most primitive use-cases for fungible tokens. Below are examples for swapping between confidential and non-confidential tokens.

==== Swap `ERC20` to `ERC7984`

Swapping from a non-confidential `ERC20` to a confidential `ERC7984` is simple and actually done within the `ERC7984ERC20Wrapper`. See the excerpt from the `wrap` function below.

[source,solidity]
----
function wrap(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual {
    // take ownership of the tokens
    SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(underlying(), msg.sender, address(this), amount - (amount % rate()));

    // mint confidential token
    _mint(to, (amount / rate()).toUint64().asEuint64());
}
----

The `ERC20` token is simply transferred in, which would revert on failure. We then transfer out the correct amount of the `ERC7984` using the internal `_mint` function, which is guaranteed to succeed.

==== Swap `ERC7984` to `ERC7984`

Swapping from a confidential `ERC7984` to another confidential `ERC7984` is a bit more complex although quite simple given the usage of the `FHE` library. For the sake of the example, we will swap from `fromToken` to `toToken` with a 1:1 exchange rate.

include::api:example$SwapERC7984ToERC7984.sol[lines=8..24]
----

The steps are as follows:

. Check operator approval
. Allow the `fromToken` to access `amount`
. Transfer from `from` to this contract for `amount`
. Allow the `toToken` to access `amountTransferred`
. Transfer `amountTransferred` to `msg.sender`

==== Swap `ERC7984` to `ERC20`

Swapping from a confidential token to a non-confidential token is the most complex since the decrypted data must be accessed to accurately complete the request. Decryption in our example will be done off-chain and relayed back using Zama's Gateway. Below is an example of a contract doing a 1:1 swap from a confidential token to an ERC20 token.
