NOTE: This document is better viewed at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/confidential-contracts/api/token

This set of interfaces, contracts, and utilities are all related to the evolving Confidential Token Standard. The standard utilizes the Zama fhEVM co-processor for manipulating FHE values. All amounts are stored on-chain as cypher-text handles (or pointers) to values stored on the co-processor.

- {ConfidentialFungibleToken}: Implementation of {IConfidentialFungibleToken}.
- {ConfidentialFungibleTokenERC20Wrapper}: Extension of {ConfidentialFungibleToken} which wraps an `ERC20` into a confidential token. The wrapper allows for free conversion in both directions at a fixed rate.
- {ConfidentialFungibleTokenUtils}: A library that provides the on-transfer callback check used by {ConfidentialFungibleToken}.
