This directory includes primitives for on-chain confidential financial systems:

- {VestingWalletCliffConfidential}: Variant of {VestingWalletConfidential} which adds a cliff period to the vesting schedule.

For convenience, this directory also includes:

- {VestingWalletCliffExecutorConfidential}: A Default implementation of `VestingWalletConfidential` which implements both `VestingWalletCliffConfidential` and execution via {ERC7821WithExecutor}.
- {VestingWalletConfidentialFactory}: A factory which allows creating `VestingWalletCliffExecutorConfidential` in batch.
