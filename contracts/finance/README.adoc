NOTE: This document is better viewed at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/confidential-contracts/api#finance

This directory includes primitives for on-chain confidential financial systems:

- {VestingWalletConfidential}: Handles the vesting of confidential tokens for a given beneficiary. Custody of multiple tokens can be given to this contract, which will release the token to the beneficiary following a given, customizable, vesting schedule.
- {VestingWalletCliffConfidential}: Variant of {VestingWalletConfidential} which adds a cliff period to the vesting schedule.
- {VestingWalletExecutorConfidential}: Extension of {VestingWalletConfidential} that adds an executor role able to perform arbitrary calls on behalf of the vesting wallet (e.g. to vote, stake, or perform other management operations).

For convenience, this directory also includes:
- {VestingWalletCliffExecutorConfidential}: A Default implementation of {VestingWalletConfidential} which supports both "cliff" ({VestingWalletCliffConfidential}) and "executor" ({VestingWalletExecutorConfidential}) extensions.
- {VestingWalletConfidentialFactory}: A factory which allows creating {VestingWalletCliffExecutorConfidential} in batch.
